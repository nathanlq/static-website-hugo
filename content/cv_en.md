## Profile

Master's student in Machine Learning, currently working as an apprentice at [DataKhi](https://datakhi.fr/), where I mainly handle data normalization, extrapolation, and database organization for the [Toss√©e](https://tossee.fr/) project. I am interested in the design and deployment of end-to-end artificial intelligence solutions. Combining a dual background in mathematics and computer science with practical experience in data engineering, I am currently developing a complete MLOps platform via my homelab. Currently pursuing a Master's in Machine Learning, I am seeking a position that combines distributed systems architecture and innovative ML solutions deployment.
